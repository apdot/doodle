## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements
-   Neovim >= 0.8
-   [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
-   [sqlite.lua](https://github.com/kkharji/sqlite.lua) 
-   sqlite3 command-line tool

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Configuration
 **IMPORTANT**: `doodle.nvim` uses a local SQLite database to store your notes. This requires the `sqlite3` command-line tool to be installed on your system.

### Plugin Configuration
Here is a minimal, real-world setup guide using `lazy.nvim`.
Add the following to your `lazy.nvim` plugin specifications. This example includes recommended keymaps.

```lua
return {
  "apdot/doodle",
  dependencies = {
      "kkharji/sqlite.lua",
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
      require("doodle").setup({
          settings = {
              -- This is the only required setting for sync to work.
              -- Set it to the absolute path of your private notes repository.
              git_repo = "path/to/your/initialized/git/repository",
          }
      })
  end,
  keys = {
      {
          "<space>df",
          function() require("doodle"):toggle_finder() end,
          desc = "Doodle Finder"
      },
      {
          "<space>ds",
          function() require("doodle"):sync() end,
          desc = "Doodle Sync"
      },
      {
          "<space>dl",
          function() require("doodle"):toggle_links() end,
          desc = "Doodle Links"
      },
  },
}
